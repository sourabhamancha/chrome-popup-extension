# chromePopupExtension
This is a chrome extension that uses jQuery to change the behaviour of the Document Object Model(DOM) of a webpage page.

Upon successful installation of this extension, a popup window is generated on opening a specific page or any page. In this case, I am manipulating the DOM of any webpage and using a google form as a popup window. However, we can also mention any other webpage as a popup.

# Usage: 
The form can be customized to be used as:

a) Acknowledgment form for the employees for any policy updates.

b) Daily/Weekly knowledge check based on process-related doubts/updates.

# Frequency: 
The pop-up form will be set at a frequency of one in 24hours with a content time limit of ~1-2 minutes.

# Impact:
This extension primarily can aid in Quality Improvement Plans for team/individuals by:

a) Employee/Team level data for knowledge checks based on the latest  updates.

b) The data can be used for team/individual specific improvement plans.

c) Increases accountability of the employees when they acknowledge any process update and is documented, while they can miss out on receiving updates from huddles/emails.
